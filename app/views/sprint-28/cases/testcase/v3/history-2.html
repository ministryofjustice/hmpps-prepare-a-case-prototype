            Plead guilty. Seems v upset, claiming  police didn't listen to him. Bereavement (brother) led to
            drinking again and girlfriend kicked him out of family home. Alcohol , child concern risk factors increased.
            Possible DV need to request callouts.</p>

          <p class="comment more">
            Mr Armstrong has completed 23 hours and has 17 hours left on his current community order with unpaid work,
            RAR days and a court accredited programme. He has a good work reports from his supervisors
            but his attendance has recently been sporadic due to bereavements and illness. He provided evidence for
            absences when asked.<br><br>
            He has attended 6 sessions of his accredited programme (Building Better Relationships). He
            is making good progress and engaging well with the course.
            <br><br>
            Mr Armstrong is suitable for a concurrent order and would benefit from a further 12 month
            community order with
            RAR days focusing on victim awareness and problem solving. I would propose up to 15 additional RAR days. He
            is
            also suitable for further unpaid work should the court wish to add this as further punishment.
